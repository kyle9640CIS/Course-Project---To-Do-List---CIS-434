# Course-Project---To-Do-List---CIS-434

A simple (for now) "To Do List" which allows the user to track various tasks

1. Allow the user to add tasks to a table
    a. Finished?
    b. Task Name?
    c. Priority?
    d. Due Date?
    
2. Allow the user to remove tasks from the table

3. Sync events to the google calendar

4. Sort the tasks by clicking on the column headers
    a. Finished
    b. Task Name
    c. Priority
    d. Due Date

5. Work on visual elements to make list more visually appealing
